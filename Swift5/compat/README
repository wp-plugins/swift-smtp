Compat files for developers upgrading Swift from versions <= 1.3.4

Class names and paths changed to proper PEAR naming between 1.3 and 2.0.
These files will allow you to keep the old class names and paths although
you are strongly advised to update your code to use the new class names and paths.

This will only work if you kept the Swift directory structure unchanged for the older
releases. i.e.

./Swift.php
./Swift/Swift_*_*.php
./Swift/plugins/Swift_*_Plugin.php

If you moved the files out of the "./Swift/" directory these compat files won't work.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1.  Copy files ./compat/*.php to ./Swift/
2.  Copy directory ./compat/plugins to ./
3.  That's all... done!

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PHPMAILER COMPAT
---------------------------------

There is a folder called "phpmailer".  This folder contains a file called "class.phpmailer.php"
just like PHPMailer.  The contents of the file are simply wrappers to proxy calls made to PHPMailer
over to Swift Mailer.

NOTE: I have to stress that the PHPMailer compat stub is in no way linked with, or supported by
 PHPMailer.  It's also not intended for permanent use.  Use it only during a migration phase.
 I cannot promise that the PHPMailer file will behave in *exactly* the same way as PHPMailer, in-
 fact, it will not.  It should keep your application working and allow you to interface with Swift
 like PHPMailer though.  There are some serious performance issues with using it (probably still
 more efficient than PHPMailer itself though!).  Convert your code to use actual swift code asap.
 
Using the stub.

1.  Copy phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php to ./ where Swift.php resides.  If for some reason you
  cannot place the file here, put it where you need it but edit the constant SWIFT_LOCATION at
  the top of the file.

2.  Use the file in exactly the same way as you would use PHPMailer.  All Done!
