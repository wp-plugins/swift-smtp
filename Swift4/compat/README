Compat files for developers upgrading Swift from versions <= 1.3.4

Class names and paths changed to proper PEAR naming between 1.3 and 2.0.
These files will allow you to keep the old class names and paths although
you are strongly advised to update your code to use the new class names and paths.

This will only work if you kept the Swift directory structure unchanged for the older
releases. i.e.

./Swift.php
./Swift/Swift_*_*.php
./Swift/plugins/Swift_*_Plugin.php

If you moved the files out of the "./Swift/" directory these compat files won't work.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1.  Copy files ./compat/*.php to ./Swift/
2.  Copy directory ./compat/plugins to ./
3.  That's all... done!
